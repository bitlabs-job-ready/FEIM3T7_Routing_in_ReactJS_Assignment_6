Create a new ReactJS application using the Create React App tool. 

Add routing to your application using the React Router library. 

Create three new components: "Home", "About", and "Contact". 

Use routing to navigate between the three components. The Home component should be the default route. The About and Contact components should be accessible via the "/about" and "/contact" routes, respectively. 

Add a navigation bar to your application that allows users to easily navigate between the three components. 

In the Home component, display a list of products. Each product should have a name, description, and image. 

In the About component, include information about your company or organization. 

In the Contact component, include a form that allows users to contact you. The form should include fields for the user's name, email, and message. 

Use the React Router library to handle the form submissions and redirect users to a "Thank You" page. 

Use the React Router library to handle any errors that may occur during form submission and redirect users to an "Error" page.
